        <h1>Hi and welcome!</h1>
        <p>I have always been a geeky kind of chap. The signs have always been there, i took the three sciences for A-Levels. In my younger years i played rugby, this started for my school, but quickly evolved to the local club, the county and higher. At 21 i stuffered a broken leg during a game, forcing me to reassess my hobbies.</p>
        <p>Many years ago my girlfriend and I moved in to Southend. While living in the center of the town I became involved in the local Linux User Group. I fell down the rabbit hole of coding, micro-controllers, web development, and genral geekery. It was at one of the club meetings which Pete Sipple came and gave a talk about Ham Radio. At the time i was far too involved in programming and rugby, but the idea of amateur radio stuck with me. When the pandemic hit it seemed like a good plan
        <p>While I can't claim to have gained any free time during the lockdowns and restrictions, i was determined to come out of the ordeal with something to show for my time. Firstly i started building coils for my vapes. I experimented with different designs, exotic types of wire, invested many hours into practice, and was happy with the result. I entered a comptetition call "Coil Wars" and didn't embarrass myself. Once the dust settled I decided to turn my attention to different persuits, and this is when i was bitten by the Ham Radio bug. After finding and signing up to the Essex Ham Foundation licence course, i started avidedly listening to shortwave broad casts. I managed to pass each of the three exams at the first time of asking, the entire process took my 6 months. Now i look forward to getting home each evening and switching the radio on, I have made a number of friends who live in the local area.</p>
        <p>This text is really just fuctioning as a placeholder, I will improve it!</p>
